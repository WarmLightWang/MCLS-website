        <p>These guidelines are designed to make MCLS an effective, fun and safe learning place. Most of them are derived from common sense and MCLS experience over the years. We sincerely ask MCLS community members follow these guidelines when conducting MCLS activities. Please send any suggestions and comments to the board (<a href="mailto:board@mcls-wisc.org">board@mcls-wisc.org</a>).</p>

            <p class="guidelines_subtitle">For Students:</p>
            <p>The MCLS is a place for learning. Although it is an extra curriculum program, to make it a fun, enjoyable and knowledge enrichment place we expect our students:</p>
            <ol class="guide_bullet">
                <li>Come to classes on time and be prepared.</li>
                <li>Pay attention to teachers.</li>
                <li>Respect teachers and fellow students.</li>
                <li>Actively participate in classes.</li>
                <li>Finish homework assignments.</li>
                <li>Do not run off to the streets.</li>
                <li>Do not run or make loud noise in the hallway during recesses.</li>

            <p class="guidelines_subtitle">For Teachers:</p>
            <p>MCLS provides a collaborative environment for teachers. The teachers enjoy Chinese language teaching and helping students. They are devoted in promoting the Chinese culture. The students, parents and board members greatly appreciate the time and effort MCLS teachers contributed in teaching and class preparation. The following is what we expect from our teachers:</p>
            <ol class="guide_bullet">
                <li>Provide a syllabus for the class you are teaching.</li>
                <li>Be prepared for the class.</li>
                <li>Be punctual. Sign in with the staff before class. Fifteen minutes late for a class may result in an hour without pay.</li>
                <li>Record and maintain a student attendance sheet.</li>
                <li>Assign and check homework if necessary. The school meets only once a week. Homework is an important part of learning.</li>
                <li>Prepare two tests (mid-term and final) in each semester for Chinese and Math classes. For other classes teachers may decide accordingly.</li>
                <li>Communicate with parents about students' needs, progress or behavior issues. Contact the board (<a href="mailto:board@mcls-wisc.org">board@mcls-wisc.org</a>) if an issue could not be resolved between you, students and parents.</li>
                <li>Work with students to give a performance or an exhibit at the end of the fall semester.</li>
                <li>If for any reason you cannot teach a class temporarily, you are responsible to notify the MCLS board (<a href="mailto:board@mcls-wisc.org">board@mcls-wisc.org</a>) at least two weeks in advance. In the event that you are unable to notify the board 2 weeks in advance, please let the board know as soon as possible.</li>
                <li>You are not to resign from your teaching position in the middle of the semester unless you are moving out of town or there is a special reason accepted by the board. In that case a written notification to the school board is required as soon as possible but no later than two weeks in advance.</li>
                <li>Return the textbooks at the end of the school year as they are provided to you for teaching purposes and are considered the school's properties. If you resign earlier, return the books on the last day of your teaching at MCLS.</li>
                <li>The MCLS reserves its right to terminate the teaching agreement if an inappropriate behavior occurs or if the quality of the teaching is compromised.</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="policy_subtitle">Class Transfer</p>
            <p>A class transfer may take place if the student, his or her parents and the school board reach an agreement. If the courses involved have the same tuition, it will be an equal exchange. If there is a difference in tuition, the difference will be either debited or credited. No processing fee is charged.</p>

            <p class="policy_subtitle">Early Registration</p>
            <p>To help us plan and prepare for a new school year, we encourage students to register early and get a $10 tuition discount for each annual course or $5 discount for each semester course. See registration form for early bird discount period.</p>

        <div>
            <p class="policy_subtitle">Class Cancellation Due to Weather or Other Circumstances</p> 
            <p>In the event of severe weather conditions and/or other unforeseeable circumstances, the board may decide to cancel the classes. Cancellation notice will be posted on the website (<a href="http://www.mcls-wisc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.mcls-wisc.org</a>) as soon as possible once the decision is made. We will also send out notification through email lists to the teachers and parents with the contact information we have on file. We may also try to contact students by phone. However, given the time and resources we have available it may be impossible to reach everyone through telephone. It is essential for students and parents to provide correct contact information (email address and phone number) at the time of registration and provide updates if the information has changed.</p>
            <P>No make up classes will be offered since we have no flexibility in the use of the class facility. If more than two cancellations occur in the same school year, students will be credited based on the prorated tuition. The credits will be applied when registering for the next school year, or refunded at the parents's request.</P>

                <span class="number1">1.</span>
                <p>The safety of our teachers and students is a very important matter in conducting our school business.</p>
            </div>

                <span class="number1">2.</span>
                <p>The facility we use to conduct the classes is on UW-Madison campus. It accessible to public and we cannot police the area on our own. Please make sure that you child is safely entered into the building and the classroom. Do not leave them in the building without the presence of either the teacher or a board member.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="numbered-item">
                <span class="number1">3.</span>
                <p>When classes are in session, there are parents and board members on site to monitor during recess. After classes are adjourned students should be picked up promptly. Children's safety should be high on the priority for all involved. Please note, teachers are not paid outside class hours and board members are all volunteering positions. Neither teachers nor board members can be held responsible for taking care students left at the school site after classes.</p>

                <span class="number1">4.</span>
                <p>When a fire alarm sounds during the class in session, teachers will lead the students to the nearby exits from the classroom. Once exit to the safety zone outside of the building, teachers and board members will take a roll call to ensure that all students are out of the building. If a parent decides to take a student out of the class while waiting outside, the class teacher should be notified before the student leaves.</p>

                <p>In case of a tornado warning, teachers will lead the students to the basement through the stairwell and wait there until the warning has been canceled before returning to the classrooms.</p>
